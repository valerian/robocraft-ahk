This script was made quickly and is still experimental.
Feel free to edit it, translate it or improve it, your feedback is welcome :) .

The minimap click feature should work fine with all resolutions, as long as you either use the same native resolution as your screen for fullscreen, or are in windowed mode.

## Minimap click message

Clicking on the minimap sends a message to your team with the coordinates you clicked on. Of course you need to press *Enter* in order to control the mouse for clicking the minimap.
**Make sure that you are in _Team_ chat, and not _Everyone_ chat**

Here is a list of possible actions, with the example of clicking on C-4 coordinates.

#### Left Click

Need help in C-4!

#### Right Click

Danger in C-4! Be careful!

#### Middle Click

Attention to C-4 against flyer

#### Click on button 4 (only some mice)

Too many people around C-4

#### Click on button 5 (only some mice)

Need more people on the path near C-4


## Cardinal directions

Pressing a keypad number sends a message with the corresponding cardinal direction (north, south, east, west, and combinations)
